Jacob added a skyscraper generator, 5 pages were written on the Theory chapter
(Noise, L-systems, Search-based PCG and Voronoi Diagrams). Marcus has finished
the terrain options: terrain offset and sea level sliders. Using the sliders,
sea level can be adjusted and the user can move along the terrain by entering a
speed given to the sliders.
Alexander worked with improving generation in the UI, like separating the road
and street generation and also implemented block and plot types so that
different things can be generated like parks or skyscrapers.
Anton has also been making improvements on the generated road network mesh. This
includes resolving bugs for specific intersections cases that caused the
intersections and roads to stretch and occupy the whole world. Furthermore, the
same problem was solved for a bug where duplicate identical roads were being
instantiated. The roads also try to project onto the terrain. The projection on
to the terrain is still a work in progress as some segements of the roads appear
underneath the terrain which needs to be resolved next week.
Work has been started with creating what will be the final structure of
BuildingGenerator. The ability of generating any type of building with different
kinds of strategy. Viktor has made sure to get his paths and parks working with
the terrain. He also added a collision-check for the paths and worked on
different algorithms for the paths.&ldquo;

In this week, Marcus has worked on the UI for the terrain generator, adding sea
level, x offset and z offset as modifiable options. A lot of PRs were
reviewed/merged such as Mesh Terrain, Noise module, plots and buildings. We aso
started on the final report and wrote about noise in the Theory chapter. Viktor
spent this week adding the Park Generator to the World Generator and doing a
little bit of report writing. We started doing daily meetings online.
Alexander worked on the road generation so that it now adjusts based on terrain
slopes and sea level in such a way that it doesn&rsquo;t enter seas or tries to ascend
to steep hills. This week Anton spent on reworking the generated road meshes
(simplifying by removing crosssection, only road width and sidewalk now) and
tweaking the intersections to a way that more similarily resembled CityEngine&rsquo;s
intersections(WIP).

This week Anton worked on creating intersections between roads. At the moment
the outline of the intersection looks reasonable - however, no actual complete
mesh is generated except for the arc &ldquo;&rdquo;corners&ldquo;&rdquo; between two roads entering the
intersection.
Alexander has worked on a general noise generator component that can be used in
many parts of the application, and also implemented the noise in the road
generation to create highways outside cities that are guided towards high
populated areas.
Jacob worked on FBX -&gt; glTF for terrain since FBX didn&rsquo;t work without depending
on UnityEditor. Since Unity&rsquo;s terrain is dynamic it doesn&rsquo;t work well in
exporting as model, you can convert it to a mesh but that also requires
UnityEditor. Thus, Jacob worked a lot on converting this terrain into a
mesh-based one, integrating it with noise module, and supporting multiple
textures and such.
Marcus has been working slightly on camera movement so that the user can look
around the city.

In this week Anton and Viktor held the halftime presentation. Viktor spent most
of the rest of the week after that working on the PathGenerator for the parks,
he was also assisted by Anton. Anton worked on coupling the generated road
network with the spline and road mesh logic(Heavily Assisted by Alexander).
Furthermore, he also has spent some time on generating a more complex shape for
the road mesh (WIP). Jacob wrote on the polygon extractor part of the block
generator. Alex and Jacob merged road generation functionalilty and block gen
inset stuff. Alex implemented the block gen inset stuff. Jacob got a .GLTF and
.GLB exporter to work in runtime. There seems to be some limis to the new
exporter, but it works better than the last one. Marcus worked on adding water
feature to the terrain and tweak the textures.

In this week everyone kept working on the generators from last week and
improving them. Viktor and Anton also spent time on preparing the half-time
presentation.  The progress in output from the generators will be provided as
images, and more detailed descriptions of how the work progress looked like will
be given in the individual week-logs. Although a very rough draft of it the road
generation logic from Anton and Alexander has started to be merged together. The
park generator is currently in hiatus as Viktor and Theodor work together on
implementing a polygon divider. We have working CI builds and linters now. We
have proper terrain, population, road, park, building (only 1 building type
though). We lack plot and block generator. We also lack a parking generator, but
that wasn&rsquo;t included in the scope of this iteration. Next week we will start a
new iteration. The current FBX exporter only works in editor runtime which is a
major concern.

&ldquo;In this week we started programming the different generators. Theodor worked with the BuildingGenerator and the PlotGenerator, Viktor worked with the ParkGenerator, Anton and Alexander with the RoadGenerator, Marcus with the TerrainGenerator.
Jacob has worked with FBX export to work in runtime, and had to try a lot of
options to get something to work. One of major problems has been to make the
FbxExporter in Unity to not depend on Editor code. Jacob also made a basic UI
that resembles the mock. Anton worked on generating a road mesh following a
(poly)bezier spline for the Road Generation.&rdquo;

Since the deadline for the project plan was coming up, this week was dedicated
to writing the content of the plan. Most of the time went to this, but there
were development in the prototypes and method ideas that we brought up from past
weeks.
</p>

<p>
In general, most sections of the report was rewritten by members that were not
originally assigned to the section, in order to increase consistency.
Everyone in the group made an effort to make sure that each of the chapters were
well-written and together made up one coherent text.

We decided we wanted to find some tools for spell-checking and grammar-checking,
so we tried a few different tools. Grammarly turned out to be the most useful
one because it helped us phrase our sentences more consistently and more
&ldquo;scientific&rdquo;, basically giving our report more credibility.

Another tool we investigated is textidote, which is a tool for LaTeX for
spelling, grammar and general LaTeX syntax checking. We mostly used this for the
syntax, since grammarly did a much better job at spelling and grammar.

<p>
This week we discussed more methods and algorithms that are commonly used in
procedurally generated content. Wave Function Collapse came up as a possible
algorithm instead of the current road generation algorithm, but we decided to
not pursue it given that the Agent-based generator would give suitable results.
</p>

<p>
Some of the eventual problems that could pose an issue for our project if we
were to use Wave Function Collapse is that our city is not really
two-dimensional, but that could be avoided. The biggest issue is that from what
we found during our research of Wave Function Collapse is that it often results
in rectangular results, but we did not want that type of consistency in our city
which is why we decided to stick with our current Agent-based method.
</p>

<p>
We also talked about machine learning and Search-based AI, but we realized that
there is not really a clear definition of how &ldquo;good&rdquo; a road is, and that is
needed for the AI to be taught. One could potentially input real world data
which would teach the AI to generate similar cities, however, none of us were
very experienced in the machine learning field and thus we decided to skip this.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb8ba0c9">
<p>
Unity and C# are by far the easiest tools to use for our project, and it suits
our needs completely. Some of us are already familiar with Unity and C#.
Everything that the project needs (and more) is offered within Unity, as well as
very powerful debugging and profiling tools. Lots of features that we want to
implement can easily be done with Unity compared to other tools available.
</p>

<p>
Some alternatives that were researched up to this week is C++ Raylib, Java
LWGJL, Java jMonkeyEngine, but these were ruled out mostly because it lacked
most of the tools that we would need which Unity already had.
Choosing one of those alternatives would mean we would have to reimplement a lot
of basic functionality that would only postpone actual development of the
project.

<p>
For the most part, this week was spent writing the project plan and the first
draft was quickly completed in order to get feedback from the supervisor.
</p>

<p>
Something that we quickly realized would be important for writing the project
plan and report was terminology.
Even within our group, we realized there were inconsistency in the meaning of
words and that meant that we had to define these very strictly in the report in
order to avoid confusion for the reader. We spent a while defining these and
they can be found in the project plan / report.

<p>
The first method of road generation turned out to be best suited for our
project, but the second method will be considered for plot generation in the
future.
A lot of progress was made on making the road generation as flexible as
possible, as well as tuning the results for better results.
</p>

<p>
The road generator now lets each agent to have its own strategy for generation
which they will follow. One example of a road strategy that is used is the Paris
or Manhattan strategy, which basically means the agents will walk around and
place roads that mimic the structure of these cities.

For the world generator, we defined a pipeline that the program will follow

whole.

It was useful to get a lot of work done this early and we quickly got a
perspective of how the city generation would work. Lots of great feedback from
our supervisor resulted in a better writing technique and better results from
the algorithm.

<p>
Lots of subjects were brought up during the workshops this week, such as what
method we wanted to use for different parts in the world generator.
We quickly came up with two methods of generating roads, and because we could
not all agree on one method we decided it was best to create two separate demos
that would demonstrate the method and its pros / cons.
</p>

<p>
The first demo would make use of road building Agents that would be deployed
onto a 2D-plane, and they would place down roads while interacting with the road
network. This would initially be a very basic system that would simply have
Agents walk in straight lines and sometimes branch off into more Agents.
</p>

<p>
The second demo would use a recursive approach where it splits the world into
small cells, and each cell would further be subdivided. The idea was to place
down a lot of points, split the cell into two by creating a line between each
point, and then recursively applying that algorithm into more detail.
</p>

<p>
We decided to postpone selecting which tools to use for our project until next
week, because we wanted to research which tool would suit us best and needed
more ticouldme.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9aa893c">
<p>
This week marks the start of the project, and thus a lot of research and
administrative tasks had to be done, such as decisions regarding tools and
a schedule.
</p>

<p>
Every decision that we make during meetings should be documented, so we decided
to create a group contract and a log book. Initially, the log book were only the
individual&rsquo;s own weekly logs, but we later realized we needed a shared log that
summarized the overall progress of the project, which is the log that you are
reading right now.

<p>
We decided to use Google Calendar for scheduled meetings, and that we should
have two lunch meetings as well as 3 workshops every week. The lunch meetings
usually were an hour long, over lunch, while the workshops were all 4 hours,
placed during Thursday afternoon, Friday morning and Friday afternoon.
The purpose of the workshops is to meet up with the group to sit down and get
work done, while also being able to get help from eachother if need be.
</p>

<p>
For communication, we decided to use Slack as it is the easier
platform which everyone was familiar with, which also gave us a more organized
form of communication than other platforms would offer (for example, Messenger).
</p>

<p>
File sharing and development ended up being Google Drive and Github. All our
documents and resources we collect during the projects lifetime would be placed
in drive for ease of access, while the project code and report is in two
separate Github repositories for version control.

We got to meet our supervisor, Staffan, during this week which guided us to get a good
start with the project, and we were also able to ask any questions we had before
getting started.
</p>

<p>
Most of us who were available also attended the introductory seminars during
this week.
</p>

<p>
The rest of the time was spent invididually, researching different aspects of
the project to get a deeper understanding of what requirements and
specifications our project would need.
