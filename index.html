This page will consist of the collaborative log from each group member and
eventual problems and challenges that the group encounters during the
development process of the project.
</p>

<p>
Usually, the group will write their own individual efforts at the end of the
week and everything will be then compose into one shared log which will be
written here.
</p>

During the final week, some minor adjustments on the report were made.
This included rendering a new cover image for the report with updated materials that render correctly in Blender.
Previously, the roofs of buildings were displayed incorrectly and the ocean appeared gray.
This was solved by changing the shader for these into the <b>Standard Unity Shader</b> that follows the <b>.glTF</b> specification.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, Jacob made some minor improvements to the bibliography of the report according to the feedback the group received from the examiner.
The references now show the actual journals and issues rather than just a DOI.

Since the exhibition was cancelled, and replaced with a video demonstrating our
project, we gave this task to Theodor.
He did a good job in demonstrating the functionality of our application, and we
all gave feedback to him.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org93f87e4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org93f87e4">Final presentation</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org93f87e4">
<p>
It was soon time for a part of the group to do the final presentation.
Alexander, Theodor, Marcus, Jacob were the ones to do the presentation, and we
decided to use Google Sheets for it.
Adding content and manuscripts for the presentation was the primary focus of
this week, as well as helping eachother by giving feedback.
By practicing the presentation quite a few times, we could ensure that the
presentation would go smoothly without any hiccups, which it did.
Our supervisor and examinator were happy with our presentation, which was good
to hear.
</p>

<p>
Finally, after we had done our presentation, it was time for the other group to
go through their opposition.
Unfortunately, the questions and feedback they gave were not very useful and
they focused on unnecessary things.
However, we did get some constructive feedback which were just simple fixes in
our report.
</p>

<p>
Afterwards, Viktor and Anton would give their opposition comments to the group
that were assigned to them, which we all thought in the group were useful and
constructive comments.
We all made sure that the most importants comments were put forward for the
group, which hopefully they went through afterwards and resolved.

It was time to get all the different branches into our master branch, so a lot
of the code needed to be rebased and merged.
It took much longer than expected, because some branches were quite old, such as
the new parking generator and road mesh branch.

The deadline for the final report was this week, so the group spent lots of time
to finish it and managed to get it to a state where we were happy with.
The report was turned in and we were awaiting the opposition from the other group.
</p>

<p>
We received the report from the other group and everyone went through it and
left feedback which would later be turned in and sent to the other group.
There were some confusion in regards with how the other group should receive the
opposition, as well as when we would receive it.
We found out that it was our responsibilty to send it to the other group, which
we did, albeit after the deadline has passed (again, due to lots of confusion
and missing information from the examinators).

Jacob spent some time fixing various aesthetical bugs, such as skyscrapers being
very thin and the broken plot division from week 10.
The library that was chosen to perform plot division had some problems, and we
had to implement some algorithms ourselves.
More details how these algorithms work can be found in the Methods chapter in
the report, specifically under the plot generator section.
</p>

<p>
Buildings also received some level of detail attention, since the buildings make
up a big part of the city, it made much sense to optimize it as well.

Alexander decided to improve the parking generator by using textured quads
instead of creating white lines individually.
This was mostly to reduce the amount of game objects in the application.
There were also a lot of discussion within the group and the supervisor that the
parking generator did not have a very good generation of asphalt below it.
So, Alexander researched and developed a terrain mesh projector class.
Basically, it extracts a portion of the terrain and applies an asphalt texture,
and slightly raising it to avoid z-fighting (a common problem where triangles in
computer graphics where triangles are overlapping).
More details is found in the parking generator in the report.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org99df5fa">
<p>
Jacob noticed that all our textures in our application was imported at an
extremely high resolution.
By reducing the resolution that the textures are imported as in the game, we
achieved a significant boost in performance.
Because the export function handles meshes and textures independently from the
game rendering, the textures are still exported in full resolution, causing no
downsides for the final end goal of exporting the mesh.
</p>

<p>
This problem was not something we anticipated would cause a huge boost in
performance. However, this was because the L-System based building generator had
not been implemented into the application yet, and buildings are very heavy on
textures.
So, it makes sense that performance would be a huge problem if this optimization
was not found.

Alexander worked on improving the function for approximating rectangles within
polygons.
Since rectangles have 4 edges, it would mean that it should be much easier to
approximate rectangles within polygons with 4 edges as well.
Thus, Alexander spent a lot of time investigating in better approximation
methods for these cases, and developed a method that gave much better results
than the general method used previously.
This method is only used if the rectangle have exactly 4 edges.

Theodor has managed to get his L-System based building generator working with
the application and the terrain.
The buildings now create basements that align with the terrain as well, after
some trial and error with transformations.
He also noticed the overhead his generator caused because of creating a huge
amount of GameObjects.
Each segment of the building had its own GameObject, which Unity has to handle
independently.
By merging each segment of a building into one GameObject, we can let Unity
handle the rendering much more efficiently.
In other terms, less GameObjects, less calls to the graphics card, more
performance.

At this point, most of our generators were implemented into the full pipeline

parameters to improve the overall look of the city and analyzed the results to
find bugs and inconsistencies.

<h4 id="org084a518">City generation</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org084a518">
<p>
The block, plot and building generation
now makes use of a population density map which previously were only used for
highways to &ldquo;guide&rdquo; the roads into other cities or high-density areas.
</p>

<p>
Amplifiers were also introduced to the population map, which basically lets us
modify the noise output. For example, when cities are placed, the population map
will get a circular amplifier in the middle of the city, which will increase the
population density closer to the center of the city.
</p>

<p>
City generation starting points and size were previously hard-coded into the
code, but now there is a feature to select points in the world while generating.
This means we can now control where cities are generated which means we can
place them in positions that might not be suitable for cities, to see what it
results in.
</p>

<p>
Roads now have dedicated sidewalks and they are also correctly projected onto
the terrain rather than clipping through it.

Theodor has come a long way with new building generator which aims to replace
the white blocky buildings we got in our old generator. By using an L-system for
generating the walls, we can get an incredible amount of flexibility in the
aesthetics of the buildings. We can set up rules depending on the floor, the
size, basically anything to generate different walls.
Currently, there are only a few different types of wall segments but this can be
extended in the future.

Note, the small buildings are still white blocks since the L-system PR

<h4 id="orgd4fdf97">City placement</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgd4fdf97">
<p>
One problem that was discovered was that placing cities in water would create
isolated road nodes that had no connections, this was quickly fixed by letting
agents who start in water wander for a few steps before terminating, and if they
encounter land they start their &ldquo;real&rdquo; road generation there.
</p>

<p>
Also, isolated cities did not get their mesh created because the mesh generator
initiates from a single node and traverses through the network, which means some
networks that are isolated would not be reached.

<div id="outline-container-orgcfbce0b" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgcfbce0b">Performance</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgcfbce0b">
<p>
We quickly noticed performance issues when the city had been fully
generated. In an attempt to fix this, some of us were profiling and analyzing
our code to see potential performance hickups.
</p>

<p>
We found that some of our code intended for debugging still did work even though
we had turned off debugging. Most generators had for-loops to visualize what they
generate, in the form of lines. To draw these lines, we used for-loops with a
debug check, but the check was performed inside the loop rather than
encapsulating the entire loop.
Simply moving the debug check to the for loop gave us some performance boosts.
</p>

<p>
However, there are still lots of performance issues when the city is finished
generating. This is likely due to the amount of triangles rendered in the scene.
But we have seen Unity projects render far more than what we have, with much
better performance, so we need to dig deeper into the engine and find out what
optimizations exists that we are not making use of.
One thought that comes to mind is the fact that our content is dynamic, and
thus, occlusion culling would not work since that requires the developer to
pre-bake occlusion data.
</p>

<p>
Alexander spent some time researching these optimizations and found that one
solution might be to merge meshes together. Having one mesh for all buildings
and roads, or at least separated into chunks, might give a significant boost,
but no actual implementation and testing has been done as of yet.

The city sometimes create very large blocks, so the purpose of the plot
generator is subdividing these blocks into smaller, more manageable blocks.
This feature is now partly implemented, as can be seen in Figure
<a href="#orgf27d321">9</a>, however, one issue we noticed is that it only
subdivides smaller blocks into two rather than big blocks into multiple
(depending on how many fit).
This issue is to be addressed at a later stage because we want to focus on the
other generators.

The building generation has gotten a few implementations this week, and it is
currently able to extrude the plots in the city to form very basic buildings.
In Figure <a href="#orgb4b501e">10</a>, there are basic building meshes in
place, however note that the normal vectors of the vertices are not correctly
calculated because vertices are shared between walls, something that it should
not be doing.
This was fixed during the last few days of the weeks and can be seen in Figure

The road generator was working pretty well at this point, but it was far from
finished.
One problem was that Agents could still step into water and traverse steep
slopes, something that is not very common in real life.
Alexander spent part of this week fixing these issues by implementing terrain
normal approximations to the noise generator, allowing the Agents to detect the
slope of the ground.
Agent now also avoid stepping into water by checking the elevation and comparing
it to the sea level. Both of these fixes are demonstrated in Figure

This week consisted of a lot of individual work to get the generators working on
their own.
Since we had trouble exporting the model, which was a main goal of the project,
Jacob continued to work on the exporter (now exporting glTF instead of FBX).
However, since the terrain still depended on the UnityEditor package because of
the dynamic mesh that we were using, this week he mainly focused on finding
alternative solutions to the terrain.
</p>

<p>
So, with the addition of Alexander&rsquo;s work on the generalized Noise component,
Jacob integrated the new noise into the terrain generator.
The dynamic mesh can be converted to a regular mesh that the exporter would work
with, but that also requires the UnityEditor package.
So the only alternative is creating the mesh entirely on our own, which is not
a problem in itself since it is a pretty trivial task.
However, a lot of complex features that the dynamic mesh offers will
not be supported in the new terrain mesh, but that is a compromise we
need to take to achieve our exporting goal.
</p>

<p>
Jacob modifed the terrain generator to produce a custom mesh instead, and
this new mesh resulted in a very reliable export feature that supported
everything that would be required in the project.
</p>

<p>
The application needed a way for the user to move around, so Marcus worked on
implementing a camera movement script.

Using the Noise component that Alexander developed, he implemented it into the
road generator by creating a highway strategy.
The point of this strategy was simply have the roads react according to the
population map, which used the Noise component.
By guiding the highways towards higher population dense areas, the road network
tended to connect to other cities, which was a nice side-effect.

It was pretty interesting to see what projects other groups had, as well as
seeing and comparing what the group that has the same project as us had
accomplished.
Something that was also interesting was that while our early focus involved the
road generation, since we deemed that to be the most complex to get right, the
other group focused on the terrain generator.

The terrain needed water, so Marcus implemented this into the application.

<p>
It was time to couple the spline and road mesh logic with the rest of the road
generator, which is exactly what Anton spent this week doing.
In order to generate the road mesh, the entire road network needed to be
traversed in such a way that duplicate roads were not created.
Another requirement that Anton and Alexander focused on with this was that roads
that did not have any intersections would only be one spline, rather than having
a spline for every connection.
So, after many implementations, Alexander and Anton managed to get a working
road network traverser which created simple boxes on every road connection,
which is demonstrated in <a href="#org5eb66ac">16</a>.

<p>
Jacob wrote the block generator and Alexander added the block inset functionality,
which was required to make sure roads did not intersect with buildings.
The function was then applied to all blocks in the entire city, shown in Figure
<a href="#org78f6560">17</a>.
At first, we were worried that the block generator would be a relatively slow
process, but that was not the case after testing.
Insetting arbitrary polygons is a very expensive process if done correctly,
since it requires a so called Straight Skeleton (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_skeleton">Straight Skeleton on
Wikipedia</a>).
However, this algorithm is very advanced and way beyond the scope of this
project to implement, so the group decided to use the Clipper library, which
handles insetting relatively well and is quite optimized as well.
</p>

<p>
For the extraction of blocks, we considered using a Minimal Cycle Basis (MCB)
algorithm, but that would be way too slow due to their time complexities.
Jacob realized that we could treat the graph as a geometric graph and thus
achieve a significantly faster complexity by making use of this assumption.

In Figure <a href="#org5252498">18</a> and Figure <a href="#orga69425f">19</a>, the
paths are using some features found in the dynamic mesh.
Since the plan is to get rid of the dynamic mesh, this needs to be changed to
work with the new terrain mesh.
</p>

<p>
Anton and Viktor discussed how this would work, and ended up waiting for the
road mesh to work with the terrain.
The idea was that once the road mesh work, they might be able to apply it to the
park paths as well, which is exactly what they ended up doing in the next couple
of weeks.

In this week everyone kept working on the generators from last week and
improving them. Viktor and Anton also spent time on preparing the half-time
presentation. The progress in output from the generators will be provided as
images, and more detailed descriptions of how the work progress looked like will
be given in the individual week-logs.
</p>

<p>
Although a very rough draft of it the road
generation logic from Anton and Alexander has started to be merged together. The
park generator is currently in hiatus as Viktor and Theodor work together on
implementing a polygon divider. We have working CI builds and linters now.
</p>

<p>
As per previous week decisions regarding this iteration, everyone spent this
time working on their own generator tasks. The progress that was made during
this week will be listed in the respective sections below.
</p>

<p>
Currently we lack a plot and block generator, but they are on their way. First,
the basic logic for creating blocks and plots needs to be implemented before a
generator can be created for it. Jacob, Theodor and Viktor is working on this.
A parking generator is also missing, which is something we want to implement,
however it is not included in the scope of this iteration.

Jacob has managed to set up a working CI for compiling the project using Github
actions, as well as a linter than will make sure every part of the project code
has the same code style, for the sake of consistency.
Right now, the linter is tricky to run locally on a Windows machine (due to Docker),
so it is mostly Jacob running the linter on the pull requests, or someone that has a
Linux environment. The benefit of running it locally is that the linter is not only
able to detect mistakes, but it can auto-magically fix them as well.

The terrain generator is now no longer implementing its own noise generation,
since there is now a standalone noise generator component that can be used with
any other generator easily. It supports specifing multiple layers with different
frequencies, magnitude and exponential factors, which gives us the ability to
fine tune and adjust any generator with great flexibility.
</p>

<p>
The terrain is currenly hooked up to this noise generator and one result of this
can be seen in Figure <a href="#org7f0ffe6">20</a>. The example in the figure
does not have a layer for adding great detail, and is mostly configured for
generating a rough terrain shape. One can add such a layer to give the result a
more realistic and detailed look, but it would also require a higher terrain
mesh resolution.

Alexander has created an Agent strategy for generating streets now, as can be

used in the prototype, and the roads generated from this strategy are marked as
streets rather than regular roads. This is useful for the road mesh to identify

Unity Asset Store that contains procedurally generated trees.

Viktor took a break with the park generator to help Theodor with a polygon

The reason this is necessary is because the road network sometimes results in
very large blocks, and a solution for that is to split it into multiple plots.
This would also result the appearance of more variation since each plot could
have a different type of building or building height, for example.

<p>
The road intersection logic that was created in the prototype had issues, so it
was necessary to set up a dedicated testing environment for all possible cases
that can occurr. So in Unity, Alexander created a playground that lets you put
down nodes with your mouse, which can be seen in Figure
<a href="#orgedf2827">24</a>, which also demonstrates the tested RTree in action.
The previous prototype used a Quadtree which resulted in far worse
performance than this RTree.
</p>

<p>
The reason an RTree was used was that it supports bounding boxes very well,
which is not the case for a KD-Tree or a spatial grid. Quadtrees have too much
depth which means more iterations while searching for elements.
More about RTrees can be read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-tree">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
This meant we could create a good connection algorithm that would take into
account intersections, snapping and nearby placement easily, something that we
could depend on working in the final generation.
</p>

<p>
Finally, when the intersection was working like we wanted to, it was time to put
it to the test, so we hooked it into the Agent generator and it worked pretty
seamlessly. The results can be seen in Figure <a href="#orgb8f930f">25</a>.
Of course, there is always bound to be bugs, which we discovered during a later
stage in development.

When it comes to the road mesh, we needed it to be smooth enough to not see the
rough imperfections of the road network. So we resorted to a simple curbic
Bezier curve, which works by interpolating values between two positions and two
control points. The basic road mesh that resulted from this is seen in Figure
<a href="#orgfdaade1">26</a>.

The first iteration of the terrain using Unity&rsquo;s built in terrain functionality

When it came to parks, we did not really mind what the final results would look
like at this stage, all we wanted was to generate trees and foliage inside a
polygon. We played around quite a bit with this, finding ways to connect a
Perlin noise to the results and instead of generating a park we ended up
generating a pretty neat looking forest. Take a look at Figure <a href="#orgf9be756">28</a>.

<p>
At this stage, we were using low poly trees found for free on the Unity Asset
store, but we switched this out at a later stage for more realistic trees.
Still, it generated a pretty nice low-poly forest!

A Definition of Done was also written which could be followed to verify pull requests.

One feature that is necessary to get working early on, in order to save

attempted to get FBX export to work in runtime. The problem is that the built-in
FBX exporter depends on Unity Editor code, but the goal is that our application
should work compiled, without any editor dependencies.

Since the deadline for the project plan was coming up, this week was dedicated
to writing the content of the project plan. Most of the time went to this, but there
were development in the prototypes and method ideas that we brought up from past
weeks.

<p>
In general, most sections of the report were rewritten by members that were not
originally assigned to those sections, in order to increase consistency.
Everyone in the group made an effort to make sure that each of the chapters were
well-written and together made up one coherent text.

<p>
Another meeting with Staffan resulted in very constructive feedback regarding
our current project plan up to this week.
</p>

<p>
We decided we wanted to find some tools for spell-checking and grammar-checking,
so we tried a few different tools. Grammarly turned out to be the most useful
one because it helped us phrase our sentences more consistently and more
&ldquo;scientific&rdquo;, basically giving our report more credibility.
</p>

<p>
Another tool we investigated was textidote, which is a tool for LaTeX for
spelling, grammar and general LaTeX syntax checking. We mostly used this for the
syntax, since grammarly did a much better job at spelling and grammar.
</p>

<p>
By this time, most of us had finished and passed the Chalmers Library Education
Online assignment which consisted of a variety of writing technique questions,
such as how to reference sources properly, evaluating source credibility and
more.

<h3 id="org530a29a">Discussion and decisions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org530a29a">
<p>
This week we discussed more methods and algorithms that are commonly used in
procedurally generated content. Wave Function Collapse came up as a possible
algorithm instead of the current road generation algorithm, but we decided to
not pursue it given that the Agent-based generator would give suitable results.
</p>

<p>
Some of the eventual problems that could pose an issue for our project if we
were to use Wave Function Collapse is that our city is not really
two-dimensional, but that could be avoided. The biggest issue is that from what
we found during our research of Wave Function Collapse is that it often results
in rectangular results, but we did not want that type of consistency in our city
which is why we decided to stick with our current Agent-based method.
</p>

<p>
We also talked about machine learning and Search-based AI, but we realized that
there is not really a clear definition of how &ldquo;good&rdquo; a road is, and that is
needed for the AI to be taught. One could potentially input real world data
which would teach the AI to generate similar cities, however, none of us were
very experienced in the machine learning field and thus we decided to skip this.

<h3 id="org876436e">Tools</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org876436e">
<p>
Unity and C# are by far the easiest tools to use for our project, and it suits
our needs completely. Some of us are already familiar with Unity and C#.
Everything that the project needs (and more) is offered within Unity, as well as
very powerful debugging and profiling tools. Lots of features that we want to
implement can easily be done with Unity compared to other tools available.
</p>

<p>
Some alternatives that were researched up to this week was C++ Raylib, Java
LWGJL, and Java jMonkeyEngine, but these were ruled out mostly because they lacked
most of the tools that we would need which Unity already had.
Choosing one of those alternatives would mean we would have to reimplement a lot
of basic functionality that would only postpone actual development of the
project.
</p>

<p>
Jacob wrote and held a presentation of Unity and some potential techniques that
could be used for certain generation parts. This helped the group get started
with some Unity concepts.

<p>
For the most part, this week was spent writing the project plan and the first
draft was quickly completed in order to get feedback from our supervisor.
</p>

<p>
Something that we quickly realized would be important for writing the project
plan and report was terminology.
Even within our group, we realized that there were inconsistency in the meaning of
words and that meant that we had to define these very strictly in the report in
order to avoid confusion for the reader and ourselves. We spent a while carefully
defining these and they can be found in the glossary of the project plan.

The first method of road generation turned out to be best suited for our
project, but the second method will be considered for plot generation in the
future.
A lot of progress was made on making the road generation as flexible as
possible, as well as tuning the results.
</p>

<p>
The road generator now lets each agent to have its own strategy for generation
which they will follow. One example of a road strategy that is used is the Paris
or Manhattan strategy, which basically means the agents will walk around and
place roads that mimic the structure of these cities.

<p>
Lots of subjects were brought up during the workshops this week, such as what
methods we wanted to use for different parts of the world generation.
We quickly came up with two methods of generating roads, and because we could
not all agree on one method we decided it was best to create two separate demos
that would demonstrate the pros and cons of each approach.
</p>

<p>
The first demo would make use of road building Agents that would be deployed
onto a 2D-plane, and they would place down roads while interacting with the road
network. This would initially be a very basic system that would simply have
Agents walk in straight lines and sometimes branch off into more Agents.
</p>

<p>
The second demo would use a recursive approach where it splits the world into
small cells, and each cell would further be subdivided. The idea was to place
down a lot of points, split the cell into two by creating a line between each
point, and then recursively applying that algorithm into more detail.
</p>

<p>
We decided to postpone selecting which tools to use for our project until next
week, because we wanted to research which tool would suit us best and needed
more time.

Every decision that we will make during meetings should be documented, so we decided
to create a group contract and a log book. Initially, the log book was only each
individual&rsquo;s own weekly logs, but we later realized we needed a shared log that
summarized the overall progress of the project, which lead to the log that you are
reading right now.

were usually an hour long, over lunch, while all the workshops were 4 hours long,
placed during Thursday afternoon, Friday morning and Friday afternoon.
The purpose of the workshops is to meet up with the group to sit down and get
work done, while also being able to get help from each other.

For communication, we decided to use Slack as everyone was familiar with it,
which also gave us a more organized form of communication than other platforms
would offer (for example, Messenger).
