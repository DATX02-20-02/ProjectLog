Usually, the group will write their own individual efforts at the end of the
week and everything will be then compose into one shared log which will be
written here.

works now during home-studies because of the Coronavirus.

<p>
Jacob has continued his report writing and spent almost the entire week writing
on the final report. Some chapters have gotten a good start already, such as the
theory, introduction and the background chapter. So far, 12 pages has been
written.
Our goal is that everyone gets started writing on the final report next week.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org44cc5fc">
<p>
At this point, most of our generators were implemented into the full pipeline
resulting in a pretty good looking city. We spent a lot of time tuning
parameters to improve the overall look of the city and analysed the results to
find bugs and inconsistencies.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgfd260d0" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgfd260d0">City generation</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgfd260d0">
<p>
The block, plot and building generation
now makes use of a population density map which previously were only used for
highways to &ldquo;guide&rdquo; the roads into other cities or high-density areas.
</p>

<p>
Amplifiers were also introduced to the population map, which basically lets us
modify the noise output. For example, when cities are placed, the population map
will get a circular amplifier in the middle of the city, which will increase the
population density closer to the center of the city.
</p>

<p>
City generation starting points and size were previously hard-coded into the
code, but now there is a feature to select points in the world while generating.
This means we can now control where cities are generated which means we can
place them in positions that might not be suitable for cities, to see what it
results in.
</p>

<p>
Roads now have dedicated sidewalks and they are also correctly projected onto
the terrain rather than clipping through it.

<h4 id="org466ba9f">Buildings</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org466ba9f">
<p>
Theodor has come a long way with new building generator which aims to replace
the white blocks we got in our old generator. By using an L-system for
generating the walls, we can get an incredible amount of flexibility in the
aesthetics of the buildings. We can set up rules depending on the floor, the
size, basically anything to generate different walls.
Currently, there are only some different types of wall segments but this can be
extended whenever.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org9049026">
<p>
Something that Jacob got working several weeks ago was finally put to the test,
the export function. We generated a complete city and exported it and the
results were quite nice. Textures are working fine and we now know for sure that
the export functionality will work fine with the whole city generated.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orge5e9a65">
<p>
One problem that was discovered was that placing cities in water would create
isolated road nodes that had no connections, this was quickly fixed by letting
agents who start in water wander for a few steps before terminating, and if they
encounter land they start their &ldquo;real&rdquo; road generation.
</p>

<p>
Also, isolated cities did not get their mesh created because the mesh generator
initiates from a single node and traverses through the network, which means some
networks that are isolated would not be reached.

<h4 id="orgec28ce9">Performance</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgec28ce9">
<p>
We quickly noticed performance issues when the city had been fully
generated. In an attempt to fix this, some of us were profiling and analysing
our code to see potential performance hickups.
</p>

<p>
We found that some of our code intended for debugging still did work even though
we had turned off debugging. Most generators has for loops to visualize what it
generates, in the form of lines. To draw these lines, we used for loops with a
debug check, but the check was performed inside the loop rather than
encapsulating the entire loop.
Simply moving the debug check to the for loop gave us significant performance
boosts.
</p>

<p>
However, there are still lots of performance issues when the city is finished
generating, and this is due to the amount of triangles rendered in the scene.
But we have seen Unity projects render far more than what we have, with much
better performance, so we need to dig deeper into the engine and find out what
optimizations exists that we are not making use of.
One thought that comes to mind is the fact that our content is dynamic, and
thus, occlusion culling would not work since that requires the developer to
pre-bake occlusion data.
</p>

<p>
Alexander spent some time researching these optimizations and found that one
solution might be to merge meshes together. Having one mesh for all buildings
and roads, or at least separated into chunks, might give a significant boost,
but no actual implementation and testing has been done as of yet.

subdivides smaller blocks into two rather than big blocks into multiple

The building generation has gotten a few implementations this week, and it is

In Figure <a href="#org5971aa1">10</a>, there are basic building meshes in
place, however note that the normal vectors of the vertices are not correctly

The road generator was working pretty well at this point, but it was by far
finished.
One problem was that Agents could still step into water and traverse steep
slopes, something that is not very realistic in real life.
Alexander spent parts of this week fixing these issues by implementing terrain
normal approximations to the noise generator, allowing the Agents to detect the
slope of the ground.
Agent now also avoid stepping into water by checking the elevation and comparing
it to the sea level. Both of these fixes are demonstrated in Figure

This week consisted of a lot of individual work to get the generators working on
their own.
Since we had trouble exporting the model, which was a main goal of the project,
Jacob continued to work on the glTF exporter.
However, since the terrain still depended on the UnityEditor package because of
the dynamic mesh that we were using, this week he mainly focused on finding
alternative solutions to the terrain.
</p>

<p>
So, with the addition of Alexander&rsquo;s work on the generalized Noise component,
Jacob integrated the new noise into the terrain generator.
The dynamic mesh can be converted to a regular mesh that the exporter would work
with, but that also requires the UnityEditor package.
So the only alternative is creating the mesh entirely on our own, which is not
really a problem since it is a pretty trivial task.
However, a lot of more complex features that the dynamic mesh offers would
obviously not be supported in the new terrain mesh, but that is a compromise we
need to take to achieve our exporting goal
The new mesh resulted in a very reliable export feature that supported
everything that was required in the project.

The application needed a way for the user to move around, so Marcus worked on
implementing a camera movement script.

Using the Noise component that Alexander developed, he implemented it into the

The point of this strategy was simply have the roads react according to the
population map, which used the Noise component.
By guiding the highways towards higher population dense areas, the road network
tended to connect to other cities, which was a nice side-effect.

<p>
It was time to couple the spline and road mesh logic with the rest of the road
generator, which is exactly what Anton spent this week doing.
In order to generate the road mesh, the entire road network needed to be
traversed in such a way that duplicate roads were not created.
Another requirement that Anton and Alexander focused on with this was that roads
that did not have any intersections would only be one spline, rather than having
a spline for every connection.
So, after many implementations, Alexander and Anton managed to get a working
road network traverser which created simple boxes on every road connection,
which is demonstrated in <a href="#orga63eb6a">16</a>.

Alexander developed the block inset functionality which was required to make
sure roads did not intersect with buildings.
The function was then applied to all blocks in the entire city, shown in Figure
<a href="#org8cf3dfe">17</a>.
At first, we were worried that the block generator would be a relatively slow
process, but that was not the case after testing.
Insetting arbitrary polygons is a very expensive process if done correctly,
since it requires a so called Straight Skeleton (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_skeleton">Straight Skeleton on
Wikipedia</a>).
However, this algorithm is very advanced and way beyond the scope of this
project to implement, so the group decided to use the Clipper library, which
handles insetting relatively well and is quite optimized as well.

In Figure <a href="#org455f99a">18</a> and Figure <a href="#org869dafe">19</a>, the
paths are using some features found in the dynamic mesh.
Since the plan is to get rid of the dynamic mesh, this needs to be changed to
work with the new terrain mesh.
</p>

<p>
Anton and Viktor discussed how this would work, and ended up waiting for the
road mesh to work with the terrain.
The idea was that once the road mesh work, they might be able to apply it to the
park paths as well, which is exactly what they ended up doing in the next couple
of weeks.

This section is work in progress!

<p>
In this week everyone kept working on the generators from last week and
improving them. Viktor and Anton also spent time on preparing the half-time
presentation.  The progress in output from the generators will be provided as
images, and more detailed descriptions of how the work progress looked like will
be given in the individual week-logs.
</p>

<p>
Although a very rough draft of it the road
generation logic from Anton and Alexander has started to be merged together. The
park generator is currently in hiatus as Viktor and Theodor work together on
implementing a polygon divider. We have working CI builds and linters now.
</p>

<p>
As per previous week decisions regarding this iteration, everyone spent this
time working on their own generator tasks. The progress that was made during
this week will be listed in the respective sections below.
</p>

<p>
Currently we lack a plot and block generator, but they are on their way. First,
the basic logic for creating blocks and plots needs to be implemented before a
generator can be created for it. Jacob, Theodor and Viktor is working on this.
A parking generator is also missing, which is something we want to implement,
however it is not included in the scope of this iteration.
</p>

<p>
The half time presentation would be held next week, so Anton and Viktor spent
time preparing for it. It consisted of our goals and current progress of the
project.

Jacob has managed to set up a working CI for compiling the project using Github
actions, as well as a linter than will make sure every part of the project code
has the same code style, for the sake of consistency.
Right now, the linter is difficult to set up on a Windows machine, so it is
mostly Jacob running the linter on the pull requests, or someone that has a
Linux environment.

<h4 id="orgf3308ca">Terrain</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf3308ca">
<p>
The terrain generator is now no longer implementing its own noise generation,
since there is now a standalone noise generator component that can be used with
any other generator easily. It supports specifing multiple layers with different
frequencies, magnitude and exponential factors, which gives us the ability to
fine tune and adjust any generator with great flexibility.
</p>

<p>
The terrain is currenly hooked up to this noise generator and one result of this
can be seen in Figure <a href="#orgb0d1710">20</a>. The example in the figure
does not have a layer for adding great detail, and is mostly configured for
generating a rough terrain shape. One can add such a layer to give the result a
more realistic and detailed look, but it would also require a higher terrain
mesh resolution.

<p>
A lot of progress has been made on the road mesh generation and it has started
getting merged together with the road network. There are still a lot of issues
and missing pieces, but Anton and Alexander has worked together to try and solve
this.
</p>

<p>
Alexander has created an Agent strategy for generating streets now, as can be
seen in figure <a href="#org1e5e844">21</a>. This is an improved version of what was
used in the prototype, and the roads generated from this strategy are marked as
streets rather than regular roads. This is useful for the road mesh to identify
what is a main road and what is a street.

We dumped the old low-poly trees since we going for a more realistic aesthetics,
so Viktor started using an asset called <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vegetation/trees/realistic-tree-9-rainbow-tree-54622">&ldquo;Realistic Tree 9 [Rainbow Tree]&rdquo;</a> on the
Unity Asset Store that creates procedurally generated trees.
</p>

<p>
He also added a restriction to trees by giving each tree a radius that blocks
other trees from generating in close proximity (see figure
<a href="#orgd0f241b">22</a>).

Viktor took a break with the park generator to help Theodor with a polygon
splitter library. This was required to start implementing a plot generator,
which main goal is taking polygons and splitting it into multiple plots.
See Figure <a href="#org2507bd2">23</a>.

</div>

<p>
The reason this is necessary is because the road network sometimes results in
very large blocks, and a solution for that is to split it into multiple plots.
This would also result the appearance of more variation since each plot could
have a different type of building or building height, for example.

The current FBX exporter is still depending on the Unity Editor. This is a major

hopefully has a solution next week.

Most of the group members spent this week working on their own parts of the
application, mostly getting each generator to do what it should. We also got a
basic GUI in place that lets the user run the generators in the pipelined
version of the application. However, it is not hooked up to much at this point,
and the generators do not take any inputs from the world generator at the
moment.

<h4 id="org799b02a">Roads</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org799b02a">
<p>
The road intersection logic that was created in the prototype had issues, so it
was necessary to set up a dedicated testing environment for all possible cases
that can occurr. So in Unity, Alexander created a playground that lets you put
down nodes with your mouse, which can be seen in Figure
<a href="#orga9b6f6e">24</a>, which also demonstrates the RTree used in action.
The previous prototype were using a Quadtree which resulted in far worse
performance than an RTree.
</p>

<p>
The reason an RTree was used was that it supports bounding boxes very well,
which is not the case for a KD-Tree or a spatial grid. Quadtrees have too much
depth which means more iterations while searching for elements.
More about RTrees can be read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-tree">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
This meant we could create a good connection algorithm that would take into
account intersections, snapping and nearby placement easily, something that we
could depend on working in the final generation.
</p>

<p>
Finally, when the intersection was working like we wanted to, it was time to put
it to the test, so we hooked it into the Agent generator and it worked pretty
seamlessly. The results can be seen in Figure <a href="#org2717e28">25</a>.
Of course, there is always bound to be bugs, which we discovered during a later
stage in development.

When it comes to the road mesh, we needed it to be smooth enough to not see the
rough imperfections of the road network. So we resorted to a simple curbic
Bezier curve, which works by interpolating values between two positions and two
control points. The basic road mesh that resulted from this is seen in Figure
<a href="#orgcaefd17">26</a>.

When it came to parks, we did not really mind what the final results would look
like at this stage, all we wanted was to generate trees and foliage inside a
polygon. We played around quite a bit with this, finding ways to connect a
Perlin noise to the results and instead of generating a park we ended up
generating a pretty neat looking forest. Take a look at Figure <a href="#org90ed292">28</a>.

At this stage, we were using low poly trees found for free on the Unity Asset

Still, it generated a pretty nice low-poly forest!

One feature that is necessary to get working early on, in order to save

should work compiled, without any editor dependencies.

<p>
Another meeting with Staffan resulted in very constructive feedback regarding
our current project plan up to this week.
</p>

<p>
We decided we wanted to find some tools for spell-checking and grammar-checking,
so we tried a few different tools. Grammarly turned out to be the most useful
one because it helped us phrase our sentences more consistently and more
&ldquo;scientific&rdquo;, basically giving our report more credibility.
</p>

<p>
Another tool we investigated is textidote, which is a tool for LaTeX for
spelling, grammar and general LaTeX syntax checking. We mostly used this for the
syntax, since grammarly did a much better job at spelling and grammar.
</p>

<p>
By this time, most of us had finished and passed the Chalmers Library Education
Online assignment which consisted of a variety of writing technique questions,
such as how to reference sources properly, evaluating source credibility and
more.

<p>
This week we discussed more methods and algorithms that are commonly used in
procedurally generated content. Wave Function Collapse came up as a possible
algorithm instead of the current road generation algorithm, but we decided to
not pursue it given that the Agent-based generator would give suitable results.
</p>

<p>
Some of the eventual problems that could pose an issue for our project if we
were to use Wave Function Collapse is that our city is not really
two-dimensional, but that could be avoided. The biggest issue is that from what
we found during our research of Wave Function Collapse is that it often results
in rectangular results, but we did not want that type of consistency in our city
which is why we decided to stick with our current Agent-based method.
</p>

<p>
We also talked about machine learning and Search-based AI, but we realized that
there is not really a clear definition of how &ldquo;good&rdquo; a road is, and that is
needed for the AI to be taught. One could potentially input real world data
which would teach the AI to generate similar cities, however, none of us were
very experienced in the machine learning field and thus we decided to skip this.

Unity and C# are by far the easiest tools to use for our project, and it suits
our needs completely. Some of us are already familiar with Unity and C#.
Everything that the project needs (and more) is offered within Unity, as well as
very powerful debugging and profiling tools. Lots of features that we want to
implement can easily be done with Unity compared to other tools available.
</p>

<p>
Some alternatives that were researched up to this week is C++ Raylib, Java
LWGJL, Java jMonkeyEngine, but these were ruled out mostly because it lacked
most of the tools that we would need which Unity already had.
Choosing one of those alternatives would mean we would have to reimplement a lot
of basic functionality that would only postpone actual development of the
project.

For the most part, this week was spent writing the project plan and the first

<p>
Something that we quickly realized would be important for writing the project
plan and report was terminology.
Even within our group, we realized there were inconsistency in the meaning of
words and that meant that we had to define these very strictly in the report in
order to avoid confusion for the reader. We spent a while defining these and
they can be found in the project plan / report.

The first method of road generation turned out to be best suited for our
project, but the second method will be considered for plot generation in the
future.
A lot of progress was made on making the road generation as flexible as
possible, as well as tuning the results for better results.
</p>

<p>
The road generator now lets each agent to have its own strategy for generation
which they will follow. One example of a road strategy that is used is the Paris
or Manhattan strategy, which basically means the agents will walk around and
place roads that mimic the structure of these cities.

<p>
Lots of subjects were brought up during the workshops this week, such as what
method we wanted to use for different parts in the world generator.
We quickly came up with two methods of generating roads, and because we could
not all agree on one method we decided it was best to create two separate demos
that would demonstrate the method and its pros / cons.
</p>

<p>
The first demo would make use of road building Agents that would be deployed
onto a 2D-plane, and they would place down roads while interacting with the road
network. This would initially be a very basic system that would simply have
Agents walk in straight lines and sometimes branch off into more Agents.
</p>

<p>
The second demo would use a recursive approach where it splits the world into
small cells, and each cell would further be subdivided. The idea was to place
down a lot of points, split the cell into two by creating a line between each
point, and then recursively applying that algorithm into more detail.

<p>
We decided to postpone selecting which tools to use for our project until next
week, because we wanted to research which tool would suit us best and needed
more ticouldme.

This week marks the start of the project, and thus a lot of research and
administrative tasks had to be done, such as decisions regarding tools and
a schedule.
</p>

<p>
Every decision that we make during meetings should be documented, so we decided
to create a group contract and a log book. Initially, the log book were only the
individual&rsquo;s own weekly logs, but we later realized we needed a shared log that
summarized the overall progress of the project, which is the log that you are
reading right now.

<li>The secretary during the meetings should be rotated according to this order:

<li>Marcus Ansamaa</li>
<li>Alexander Arvidsson</li>
<li>Anton Håkansson</li>
<li>Viktor Truvé</li>

<li>The report should be written in LaTeX and it should be written in Swedish
(this decision was later changed to english in a future decision).</li>
<li>Theodor is responsible for booking group rooms for meetings.</li>

We decided to use Google Calendar for scheduled meetings, and that we should
have two lunch meetings as well as 3 workshops every week. The lunch meetings
usually were an hour long, over lunch, while the workshops were all 4 hours,
placed during Thursday afternoon, Friday morning and Friday afternoon.
The purpose of the workshops is to meet up with the group to sit down and get
work done, while also being able to get help from eachother if need be.
</p>

<p>
For communication, we decided to use Slack as it is the easier
platform which everyone was familiar with, which also gave us a more organized
form of communication than other platforms would offer (for example, Messenger).
</p>

<p>
File sharing and development ended up being Google Drive and Github. All our
documents and resources we collect during the projects lifetime would be placed
in drive for ease of access, while the project code and report is in two
separate Github repositories for version control.

We got to meet our supervisor, Staffan, during this week which guided us to get a good
start with the project, and we were also able to ask any questions we had before
getting started.
</p>

<p>
Most of us who were available also attended the introductory seminars during
this week.
</p>

<p>
The rest of the time was spent invididually, researching different aspects of
the project to get a deeper understanding of what requirements and
specifications our project would need.
